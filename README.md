# 2025_capstone_server
Requires the following node libraries to run:

node-midi: https://www.npmjs.com/package/midi
osc (NOT node-osc): https://www.npmjs.com/package/osc

Depending on your setup you may need to mess with the midi port number being used for the server to detect whatever midi device you have plugged in.
